# 🏦 Bank Customer Churn Prediction

This project builds an MLOps-ready pipeline to predict customer churn for a bank using various machine learning models. It includes data preprocessing, class balancing, model training, evaluation, and MLflow-based experiment tracking and model versioning.

## 🧠 Models Trained

* Logistic Regression
* Random Forest
* XGBoost

Each model is evaluated using:

* Accuracy
* Precision
* Recall
* F1 Score
* Confusion Matrix

Confusion matrices are saved and logged as MLflow artifacts.

---

🗂 Model Registry
After training, the top 2 models are automatically registered with MLflow and promoted to appropriate stages.

✅ Model Promotion
Model	Stage	Justification
RandomForest_model	Production	Best overall performance (F1 and accuracy), reliable and interpretable
XGBoost_model	Staging	Competitive performance, ideal backup with high recall capability

To register models:

```bash
# Inside train.py or separately
from src.registry import register_top_models
register_top_models()
```
